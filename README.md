DWI Lens Visualiser
===================

Status
------

It works!

Description
-----------

I have found that [DWI Digital Cameras](http://www.dwidigitalcameras.com.au/astore/Default.aspx) have always ended up the most affordable place to buy camera gear.  
I also find the website a little bit hard to navigate.  
This app takes a HTML page from DWI and presents it in a graph format that allows you to narrow down your search based on focal length with the color of the plotted elements representing price.


TODOs
-----

- Add a favicon, apple-touch-icon, etc.
- Make the graph more touch friendly?
